About Project:
This flyer was designed to promote Silent Storms, a charitable initiative dedicated to supporting the mental well-being of men aged 18 and above. Given that many participants are over the age of 70, the flyer was carefully crafted with enlarged text and visuals to ensure accessibility and ease of reading. The layout prioritizes clarity, engagement, and responsiveness, making it visually inclusive for all audiences.
